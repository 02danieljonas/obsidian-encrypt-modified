# Obsidian Encrypt Plugin

**Create encrypted notes within your [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/) vault.**

Encrypted notes are never decrypted to disk (unless you use the decrypt in-place feature) giving you piece-of-mind that the decrypted contents haven't been sync'd or backed up to external systems.



> ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING - Use at your own risk ‚ö†Ô∏è
> - Your passwords are never stored anywhere, if you forget your passwords you can't decrypt your notes.
> - No known audits have been undertaken for the soundness of encryption methods being used.  Unwanted decryption by a 3rd party may be possible if they have access to your files.
> - Bugs could be introduced to the software at anytime, you are responsible for having backups of your notes.

## ‚öúÔ∏è Installation

You can install the plugin via the Community Plugins tab within Obsidian by searching for "Meld Encrypt"

### v2.0.0

To make encrypted notes more resilient, starting from v2.0.0, the plugin introduces a new .encrypted note.

The advantages of this new approach are:

- Your note contents are always encrypted on disk.
- Encrypted bytes are hidden away from the user making it difficult to accidentally corrupt the encryption and thus making the note un-decryptable.
- Encrypted notes are easily identifiable by their '.encrypted' file extension.
- Better workflow for editing encrypted notes.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è It is recommended that you change all previously inline encrypted text into the new encrypted note format.
