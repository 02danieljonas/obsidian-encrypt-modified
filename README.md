# Obsidian Encrypt Plugin

Hide secrets in your [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/) notes.

This plugin allows you to encrypt portions of your notes allowing you to store sensitive details along with other information.

Under the hood it uses the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) cipher from the [Crypro-ES](https://github.com/entronad/crypto-es) module.

> NOTE: Your passwords are never stored anywhere, if you forget your password you can't decrypt your text.

## Usage
